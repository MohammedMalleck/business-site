# Overview

This is a business website for a freelance Web Developer. It was crafted to attract potential non-technical clients and help them create a online
precence. Figma was used for creating the design and technologies like html , scss and js were used to bring it to life. Webpack bunlder along with some libraries 
were also used.

## How can you help?

- Create issues that contribute to negative(and huge) user experience.
- Fork the repository and create pull requests of refactored code.

## Future Updates

- Making the website multi language(English & Arabic).
- Displaying a note that slides in, informing the user they can view a better version (e.g., switching to Chrome or disabling reduce motion) when using lower versions of Safari (< 16.6) or when reduce motion is enabled.

## Acknowledgements

- Thanks to [@RGHANILOO](https://github.com/RGHANILOO) who helped me re-design this site. Initially the project was going something like [this](https://github.com/MohammedMalleck/M-Malleck-Business) , after some of his reviews I started from scratch(again).
