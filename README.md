# Overview

This is a business website for a freelance Web Developer. It was crafted to attract potential clients and help them create a online precence. Figma was used for creating the design and technologies like html , scss and js were used to bring it to life. Webpack bunlder along with some libraries 
were also used.

## How can you help?

- Create issues that contribute to negative(and huge) user experience.
- Fork the repository and create pull requests of refactored code.

<br>

## Recent Updates

- Replaced the Services section with a Projects section. The previous Services section created the impression that I only build websites for a specific niche, which is not the case. The new Projects section addresses this by showcasing my recent work along with client testimonials.

<br>

## Future Updates

- Making the website multi language(English & Arabic).
- Displaying a note that slides in, informing the user they can view a better version (e.g., switching to Chrome or disabling reduce motion) when using lower versions of Safari (< 16.6) or when reduce motion is enabled.
